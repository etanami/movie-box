# HNG STAGE 2 PROJECT

This template provides a minimal setup to get the project working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## ABOUT

This project is a frontend project built by me in stage 2 of my HNG internship. It is a MovieBox application that functions similar to a netflix app.

At the moment, the app allows users view the top 10 movies of all time from the TMDB api. It allows users click on the result cards to view individual movie details.


### RUN PROJECT

* npm install - to install the dependecies
